<H1>Task 2: Real-World Challenge: Aligning Web Directories</H1>

<H2>Focus of this Alignment Task</H2>
<P>The focus of this task is to evaluate performance of existing alignment tools 
  in real world taxonomy integration scenario. Our aim is to show whether ontology 
  alignment tools can effectively be applied to integration of "shallow ontologies". 
</P>
<P>The evaluation dataset was extracted from <a href="http://www.google.com/dirhp">Google</a>, <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> and <a href="http://www.looksmart.com/r?country=uk">Looksmart</a> web directories. 
The specific characteristics of the dataset are:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>More than 4500 of node matching tasks, where each node matching task is composed from the paths to root of the nodes in the web directories. 
  <LI>Expert mappings for all the matching tasks. 
  <LI>Simple relationships. Basically web directories contain only one type of 
    relationship so called &quot;classification relation&quot;.
  <LI>Vague terminology and modeling principles: The matching tasks incorporate the typical "real world" modeling and terminological errors. 
</UL>
<P>This implies that the task will be challenging from a technological point of 
view, but there is guidance for tuning matching approach that needs to be taken 
into account. The papers describing the datatset construction methodology are <a href="../../2006/directory/taxme1.pdf">TaxME</a> and <a href="../../2006/directory/taxme2.pdf">TaxME 2</a>.</P>

<H2>The Data</H2>

<P>The node matching tasks are represented by pairs of OWL ontologies,
  where classification relation is modeled as OWL subClassOf
  construct. Therefore all OWL ontologies are taxonomies (i.e., they
  contain <b>only classes</b> (without Object and Data
  properties) <b>connected with subclass relation</b>. 
  The dataset can be downloaded 
  from <a href="../../2006/directory/ptr.zip">here</a>. The matching tasks are numbered
  from 1 to 4640.
  Thus, for example, the first matching task is to find a mapping
  between 1/source.owl and 1/target.owl and to output it to a file
  called 1/yourname.rdf.</p>

<p>
The alternative representation of the same data is two large scale OWL taxonomies. They can be downloaded from <a href="../../2006/directory/full.zip">here</a>. Two taxomonies incorporating 10% of the node matching tasks can be downloaded from <a href="../../2006/directory/10.zip">here</a>.  
</p>

<H2>Task and Submission of Results</H2>

<P>The task is to find an alignment between classes in the
  ontologies. 
In order to find the alignment any information in the
  two models can be used. In addition, it is allowed to use background
  knowledge, <B>that has not specifically been created for the
  alignment tasks</B> (ie no hand-made mappings between parts of the
  ontologies). Admissible background knowledge are "Oracles" such as
  WordNet, Cyc, UMLS, etc. Further, results must not be tuned manually
  by for instance removing obviously wrong mappings. Participants are encouraged to submit the results for all representations of the dataset (i.e., both for node matching tasks and large scale taxonomies). 
</P>


<P>Results of the alignment should be represented using the <A 
href="https://moex.gitlabpages.inria.fr/alignapi/format.html">common format for alignments</A>
  and send
  to <A href="mailto:yatskevi@dit.unitn.it">yatskevi@dit.unitn.it</A>
  for evaluation by September 1st. Quantitative indicators of matching quality (Precision and Recall) will be returned to participants till September 15th.</P>
