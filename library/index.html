<h1>OAEI 2007 National Library of the Netherlands (KB) Thesaurus Mapping
Task</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Participants of this task are expected to align two Dutch thesauri used to
index books from two collections held by the National Library of the
Netherlands (<a href="http://www.kb.nl">KB</a>). The required alignments
links are inspired by the SKOS and SKOS mapping vocabularies. The results
will be evaluated by members of the STITCH project and domain experts in KB.

<h2>Alignment task</h2>

<h3>Collections and vocabularies</h3>

<p>KB maintains two big collections: the <a
href="http://netuit.kb.nl/">Deposit Collection</a>, containing all the Dutch
printed publications (one million items), and the Scientific Collection,
with about 1.4 million books mainly about the history, language and culture of
the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Each collection is described according to its own indexing system and
conceptual vocabulary. On the one hand, the Scientific Collection is
described using the <strong>GTT</strong>, a huge vocabulary containing 35,000
general concepts ranging from Wolkenkrabbers (Sky-scrapers) to Verzorging
(Care). On the other hand, the books contained in the Deposit Collection are
mainly indexed against the <strong>Brinkman thesaurus</strong>, containing a
large set of headings (more than 5,000) that are expected to serve as global
subjects of books. Both thesauri have similar coverage (there are more than
2,000 concepts having exactly the same label) but differ in granularity.</p>

<p>For each concept, the thesauri provide the usual lexical and semantic
information: preferred labels, synonyms and notes, broader and related
concepts, etc. The language of both thesauri is Dutch, but a quitesubstantial
part of Brinkman concepts (around 60%) come with English labels. For the
purpose of the alignment, the two thesauri have been represented according to
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a> model, which provides
with all these features.</p>

<p><strong>The goal of the task is to find semantic links between the
concepts contained by these GTT and Brinkman thesauri.</strong></p>

<p></p>

<h3><a name="mappingconfigs">Expected Alignments</a></h3>

<p></p>

<p>The expected alignments shall come in the format defined for the <a
href="https://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2007/align.html">Ontology Alignment
API</a>.</p>

<p>As the context of the task is clearly thesaurus-based information systems,
the alignment links to be produced shall be compatible with standard
thesaurus semantic links.</p>

<p>Especially expected are alignment links found in the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/mapping/spec/">SKOS mapping</a>
vocabulary namespace (<code>http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/mapping#</code>,
referred to as <code>skosm:</code> below):</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>skosm:exactMatch</code>, which denotes equivalence between two
    concepts</li>
  <li><code>skosm:broadMatch</code> and <code>skosm:narrowMatch</code>
    denoting hierarchical generalization and specialization</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, an adhoc link denoting general relatedness is allowed and
will be evaluated:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>http://stitch.cs.vu.nl/mapping#relatedMatch</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The other semantic relations found in SKOS mapping vocabulary are allowed
but <em>will not be evaluated</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>skosm:minorMatch</code></li>
  <li><code>skosm:majorMatch</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, SKOS mapping provide with three classes that allow to map defined
concepts. These are allowed, but will not all be evaluated:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>skosm:AND</code> and <code>skosm:OR</code>, denoting intersection
    and union of concepts, <em>will be evaluated</em>;</li>
  <li><code>skosm:NOT</code> <em>will not be evaluated</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>Note on alignment cardinality and confidence measure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>results can come with confidence measures, even though these will not
    be formally evaluated;</li>
  <li>it is allowed to have a same concept involved in different mapping
    links (1-n and m-n mapping situations)</li>
</ul>

<p>The alignments shall be sent to the organizers of the task, Antoine Isaac and Henk
Matthezing.</p>

<h2><a name="collections" id="collections">Evaluation</a></h2>

<p>Evaluation of the alignments will be done by members of the STITCH team
with the help of domain experts. Due to the size of the vocabulary, only
sample evaluation will be caried out.</p>

<p>The modality of this sample evaluation will be determined, depending for
example on the number of participants.</p>

<p>A special attention will be given to application relevance. Especially,
criteria for evaluation will be chosen according to specific application
scenarios like query reformulation, book annotation or unified thesaurus
design.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
The data for the two vocabularies can be asked for by sending mail to the
organizers of the task, <a
href="mailto:Henk dot Matthezing at kb dot nl">Henk Matthezing</a> and <a
href="mailto:aisaac at few dot vu dot nl">Antoine Isaac</a>. Participating
requires accepting the terms of this <a
href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/nl/deed.en">creative
commons licence</a> and committing not to use the data for a purpose other
than the OAEI campaign. [This situation is caused by the data coming from two
different environments]

<p>Please notice that this e-mail process is not only expected to ensure
compliance with IP situation. It will also help us to keep contact with
participants, for instance if a new version of the data is produced, after a
complaint by a participant.</p>

<h2>Time schedule</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Participants submitted a preliminary version of their alignment on August 15th.</li>
  <li>Final mappings were submitted on September 7th.</li>
  <li>Evaluation (thesaurus merging scenario) has been done for October 5th</li>
  <li>Evaluation (book re-indexing scenario) has been done for November 5th</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="OWL">OWL Variant for this Task</a></h2>

<p>In case the participants' tool cannot input or output the proposed SKOS
(-inspired) data, OWL versions are provided, and OWL alignment relationships
can be evaluated. Notice, however, that this amounts to making specific
interpretations of the original data and produced alignments, and might
reduce the quality of the final results.</p>

<p>The following conversions were made regarding the data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>instances of <code>skos:Concept</code> are converted into instances of
    <code>owl:Class</code>;</li>
  <li><code>skos:prefLabel</code>, <code>skos:altLabel</code> and
    <code>skos:hiddenLabel</code> statements are converted to
    <code>rdfs:label</code> statements, which removes the subtle distinctions
    that exist between these different properties (in GTT for instance, many
    <code>altLabel</code>s are not synonyms at all)</li>
  <li>various kind of <code>skos:note</code>s are converted to
    <code>rdfs:comment</code>s;</li>
  <li><code>skos:broader</code> statements are converted into
    <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> statements;</li>
  <li><code>skos:related</code> statements are converted into
    <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> statements.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following interpretations will be made of OWL data sent back by
participants:</p>
<ul>
  <li>instances of <code>owl:Class</code> will be interpreted as instances of
    <code>skos:Concept</code>;</li>
  <li><code>owl:equivalentClass</code> statements will be interpreted as
    <code>skosm:exactMatch</code> statements;</li>
  <li>if participants align the original concepts (as instances of
    <code>skos:Concept</code> and not <code>owl:Class</code>) using
    <code>owl:sameAs</code>, these statements will also be interpreted as
    <code>skosm:exactMatch</code>s;</li>
  <li><code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> statements will be interpreted as
    <code>skosm:broaderMatch</code> statements;</li>
  <li><code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> statements will be interpreted as
    <code>stitchm:relatedMatch</code> statements;</li>
  <li>if participants' tools output alignments involving defined classes
    using owl:intersectionOf and owl:unionOf respectively, the concerned
    statements will be interpreted as statements involving
    <code>skosm:AND</code> and <code>skosm:OR</code>. Disjunction-like
    statements (<code>owl:disjoint</code>, <code>owl:differentFrom</code>,
    <code>owl:disjointWith</code>, <code>owl:ComplementOf</code> which could
    be interpreted as statements involving <code>skosm:NOT</code>) will be
    ignored, as these are not evaluated.</li>
</ul>
